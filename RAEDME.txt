In this project I built implementation for the game Reversi in OOP way.
I also programmed several players for the game:
- Real player (for human user to play)
- Random player
- Simple player: plays the moves the would turn the maximum disks of the opponent 
- Stratgic Player: uses minmax algorithm to chose its next move
